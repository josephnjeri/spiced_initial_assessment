# spiced_initial_assessment

The assessement is a preliminary examination for admission to the online data science course in Berlin.
'spiced' directory contains the code and data necessary to carry out the work. 
It also has the results folder where a scatter plot is saved.
Under spiced/code, a script by the name 'task_methods.py' contains the DataProcessing class.
The class contains all methods used to fullfill the tasks.
Implementation of the class methods is done under the 'main.py' script found in this directory

Requirements: Latest Anaconda distribution
To generate results at once, type 'python main.py' without quotes
